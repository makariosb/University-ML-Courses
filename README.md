# Pattern Recognition Lab Excercises

These relatively simple MATLAB files were developed in 2019 for the Pattern Recognition class of my studies in  Electrical & Computer Engineering in University of Patras.

The main theme of each lab excercise is presented for reference as follows:

| Lab Number | Lab Theme|
-------------|-----------
| Lab 1 | Intro to MATLAB, matrix calculations, plotting datasets |
| Lab 2 | Classification using class centroids, classification errors |
| Lab 3 | K-means classification |
| Lab 4 | Linear Classification using the Perceptron algorithm |
| Lab 5 | Linear Classification using the Ho-Kashyap algorithm|
| Lab 6 | Multi-level Perceptron Neural Networks and Back-propagation |

# Data Processing & Machine Learning Projects
These MATLAB files were developed in 2020 for the Data Processing & Machine Learning Projects class of my studies in  Electrical & Computer Engineering in University of Patras.

The central theme of each project is summarised in the table below:

| Project Number | Theme/Curriculum covered |
-----------------|-------------------------
|Project 1|Naive Bayes Classifier, Likelihood ratio estimation using neural networks (MATLAB implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00405))|
|Project 2|Support Vector Machines, Hilbert Spaces, Kernel Functions|
|Project 3|K-means, artificial dimensionality increase, Expectation Maximization in Gaussian Mixture Models|

In addition to the developed code, the project description, as well as my final report on it can be found in each of the project's folders. Written in modern greek.
